# Updating Govigedit

For now, updating Govigedit is slightly more involved than adding the package. 

## General updating steps

1. Delete following folders: 
   * Davigo
   * Govidad
   * Photon
   * Toolbox

2. Import the new package. 

## Updating to 2.x.x from Govigedit 9 and below

* On any custom rigidbodies, add the `Owner` component. 

Otherwise, should be a re-export. 

If you have any issues updating, please tell us in the DAVIGO discord.
