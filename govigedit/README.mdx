# Welcome to the DAVIGO Map Editor docs!

The map editor is a tool that allows users to design and play their own maps for [Davigo, a VR vs. PC battle game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116540/DAVIGO/).

The map editor (and this documentation) is a work-in-progress and there will be breaking changes leading up to Steam early access. Here be dragons!

For feedback, bug reporting and feature requests, please join the [Davigo Discord](https://discord.gg/5du5Ack).
