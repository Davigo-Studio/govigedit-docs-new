# Govigedit 3.0.0 changelog

:::note
If you are updating from Govigedit 9 or less, make sure to follow the instructions [here](/govigedit/guides/updating)
:::

- Updated to latest Davigo codebase. This is a breaking change, hence the bump to 3. 
- Changed killbox to allow specifying a floor collider. Specifying this will mean the camera will not go below the collider. Noting the killzone will be replaced soon with a better solution.
