# Map Issues

This shows you all potential problems with the currently open map. We recommend checking this every time before exporting your map, as it can highlight some issues without you having to figure it out after an export.

It will also show you how many tris your map is, how many renderers your map has, and if it uses custom shaders or not. [More info here.](/govigedit/guides/performance)
