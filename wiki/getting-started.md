# Getting Started

This is the beginner guide, made in the hopes that everyone having common problems might find solutions. This will start from the bare basics.

## How do I get the game?

You can now get the game off of either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116540/DAVIGO_VR_vs_PC/) or [AppLab](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6244027602378363/)

You can alternatively play using the free KNIGHT'S PASS, which is on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116540/DAVIGO_VR_vs_PC/). This is a free version without VR, intended for playing with friends who don't own the game.

## How do I install custom maps manually?

### Manually (PC)

1. Get your map(s) from wherever

2. Place them in the `%localappdata%\Davigo\OnlineMaps` directory

3. Open an online lobby, and find the map in the custom maps section.

### Manually (Quest)

1. Get your map(s) from wherever

2. Put the map file in `Android\data\com.davigostudio.davigoquest\files\Davigo\OnlineMaps` via SideQuest (or some other Android file browser tool).

3. Open an online lobby, and find the map in the custom maps section.

## What headsets does the game support?

The game currently supports all SteamVR supported headsets.

## Do the hands move a bit slower in Davigo than in real life?

This behaviour is intentional! It ensures that the giant cannot overwhelm the warrior with too much speed, and requires wind-ups for ground pounds and throws.

## The giant/warrior is too strong compared to the warrior/giant.

There's definitely imbalances right now, and the imbalances tend to shift along the skill curves. We've found balance goes back and forth when we add new features (e.g., room scale maps that allow the giant to walk around make them much stronger).

## My play space is super small, so it's tough to move as the giant without hitting things in my area

This is a pretty common issue for people with smaller play spaces, and is something we are currently experimenting with a solution for.
